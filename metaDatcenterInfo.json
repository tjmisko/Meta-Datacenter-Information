As of this year, 52% of the site's waste has been recycled or composted, equating to nearly 170 tons of waste mitigated. We invest in Altoona through our Community Action Grants program which funds local nonprofits, schools and projects that are furthering STEM education, connecting people online and off, and putting the power of technology to use for community benefit. One grant recipient is the Southeast Polk High School who's grant helped fund the development of an aquaponics lab.</p>\n",
